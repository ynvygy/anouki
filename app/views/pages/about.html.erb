
<p>about me

i am a freelance artist born and raised in Vienna, Austria.. i started drawing in summer of 2012 and it was quite the coincidence: i went into one big book store in Vienna where i saw a set of copics – it contained a black 0.3 and i think 4 ciao markers.. while my head was still wondering what i will do with those pens (i never considered myself to be a creative person in any way, let alone an artist), my feeling and impulse of buying them were stronger.. back at home i tried them out and made my first actual drawing called ‘jay’ in that time..

the real birth of Anouki Art happened end of 2013.. i found my old sketches and decided to give it another go and suddenly the realization came that this was my passion and my calling.. i made the decision to commit to my art and take it to the next levels.. i was living in Bratislava, Slovakia at the time – a city that i have a special connection with.. it is the birthplace of Anouki Art and it’s also the re-birthplace of me..

i use copic multiliners and ciao markers to create my drawings and i do so mainly intuitively – meaning i just start with the pattern i receive in the moment and i hardly ever have any concept of where the drawing will go and how it will look like in the end.. this keeps it exciting also for me, i am always surprised by the end results.. my drawings are very energetic and even though they are not really dimensional they contain a certain depth and movement.. the longer you look at them, the better you can see and actually feel it.. mostly they are very colorful creations as i enjoy the beautiful and vibrant colors that copics offer.. i literally feel like riding on rainbows when i use all my colors! and this makes my child-like nature very happy!

i don’t draw for any special purpose except for the expression of my self.. but if i had one vision it would be to see more people discover their own artist inside.. to become more brave and forget all about if what they do is ‘good’ or not.. i would like people to just express what they feel like, for the only purpose of self-expression and totally free of judgement or rules..

i have started to offer workshops to help make this vision become real.. if you are interested, please contact me – i will upload more content about this soon but at the moment my page is still under construction..
